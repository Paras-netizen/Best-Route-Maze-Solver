# Best-Route-Maze-Solver

Inside of a Maze where there are multiple obstacles , enclosed by Walls, we try to find the best path to reach the end dodging all the
hindrances in the path. We take the help of A Star Searching Algorithm.
What is A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

Why A* Search Algorithm ?
Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart 
algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps 
use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).
